# Stock assessment of sea garfish in New South Wales (Australia)

## Introduction

This repository provides the methods, scripts, data and results that are used to estimates the status of the sea garfish fishery in New South Wales (Australia).

## Data
The data consists of measurements of age from a sample of commercial catches (https://github.com/mkienzle/NSW-sea-garfish-stock-assessment/blob/master/Data/GarfishAgeData.csv), measurements of weights of individual fish at age (https://github.com/mkienzle/NSW-sea-garfish-stock-assessment/blob/master/Data/GarfishWeightAtAge.csv), total catch (https://github.com/mkienzle/NSW-sea-garfish-stock-assessment/blob/master/Data/GarfishCatchData.csv) and effort (https://github.com/mkienzle/NSW-sea-garfish-stock-assessment/blob/master/Data/GarfishEffortData.csv).

## Methods

Mortality rates were estimated by maximimum likelihood applying methods taken from survival analysis (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13253-015-0237-y).
