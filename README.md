# Stock assessment of sea garfish in New South Wales (Australia)

## Introduction

This repository provides the methods, scripts, data and results that are used to estimates the status of the sea garfish fishery in New South Wales (Australia). The data consists of measurements of age from a sample of commercial catches (https://github.com/mkienzle/NSW-sea-garfish-stock-assessment/blob/master/Data/GarfishAgeData.csv), measurements of weights of individual fish at age, total catch and effort.
